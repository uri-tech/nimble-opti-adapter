nimble-opti-adapter is a Kubernetes operator that automates certificate renewal management when using ingress with the annotation `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` for services that require TLS communication. This operator is designed to work seamlessly with the NGINX ingress controller, efficiently handling the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS` annotation.

## ⚙️ Operator Workflow

The operator monitors the creation and modification of both CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) of kind `NimbleOptiAdapter` and Ingress resources. The following is a detailed overview of the operator's behavior:

1. If a CRD of kind `nimble-opti-adapter` is created or modified, the operator currently performs no action.

2. When an Ingress resource is created or modified, the operator's controller checks for the presence of the `nimble.opti.adapter/enabled: "true"` label:

   - If the label does not exist, the operator takes no action.
   - If the label exists, the operator checks for the presence of a `NimbleOptiAdapter` CRD in the same namespace:
     - If the CRD does not exist, the operator creates a new `NimbleOptiAdapter` CRD with default values and proceeds as if the CRD already existed.
     - If the CRD exists, the operator checks if any path in `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` contains `.well-known/acme-challenge`. If so, the operator initiates the certificate renewal process for the Ingress resource.

3. Once a day, the operator checks all Ingress resources with the label `nimble.opti.adapter/enabled: "true"` and associated `NimbleOptiAdapter` CRD resource in the same namespace:

   - If there is no match, the operator takes no action.
   - If there is a match, the operator checks if the Secret name specified in `spec.tls[].secretName` exists for each tls[], retrieves the Secret, and calculates the time remaining until the certificate expires:
     - If the certificate expires in equal or fewer days than the `CertificateRenewalThreshold` specified in the `NimbleOptiAdapter` resource in the same namespace, the operator initiates the certificate renewal process.
     - If the certificate expires in more days than the `CertificateRenewalThreshold` specified in the `NimbleOptiAdapter` resource in the same namespace, the operator checks if any path in `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` contains `.well-known/acme-challenge`:
       - If there is no match, the operator takes no action.
       - If there is a match, the operator initiates the certificate renewal process.

4. Certificate renewal process:
   - Remove the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS` annotation from the Ingress resource.
   - Start a timer and wait until either there is no `spec.rules[].http.paths[].path` containing `.well-known/acme-challenge`, or the `AnnotationRemovalDelay` time specified in the `NimbleOptiAdapter` CRD resource has passed.
   - Re-add the annotation `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS` to the Ingress resource.

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.16+)
- Helm (v3+)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uri-tech/nimble-opti-adapter.git
cd nimble-opti-adapter
```

### Step 2: Install the operator using Helm

```bash
helm install nimble-opti-adapter ./helm/nimble-opti-adapterconfig
```

### Step 3: Modify the operator

To modify the operator, edit the Helm chart templates or values.yaml file in the helm/nimble-opti-adapterconfig directory.

### Step 4: Update the operator using Helm

Repackage the Helm chart and upgrade the release with the following commands:

```bash
cd nimble-opti-adapter/helm/
helm package nimble-opti-adapterconfig
helm upgrade nimble-opti-adapter ./nimble-opti-adapterconfig-0.1.0.tgz
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit the `values.yaml` file in the `helm/nimble-opti-adapterconfig` directory to customize the following parameters:

- `labelSelector`: The label selector for namespaces the operator will manage certificates in (default: `nimble.opti.adapter/enabled: 'true'`)
- `certificateRenewalThreshold`: The waiting time (in days) before the certificate expires to trigger renewal
- `annotationRemovalDelay`: The delay (in seconds) after removing the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: HTTPS` annotation before re-adding it

## 📝 Usage

Label the Ingress where the operator should manage certificates:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: your-target-ingress
  labels:
    nimble.opti.adapter/enabled: "true"
```

Create a nimble-opti-adapter custom resource in any namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: nimble-opti-adapter.example.com/v1alpha1
kind: nimble-opti-adapter
metadata:
  name: example-config
spec:
  certificateRenewalThreshold: 30
  annotationRemovalDelay: 60
```

## 📊 Metrics

nimble-opti-adapter exposes the following Prometheus metrics:

- `nimble-opti-adapter_certificate_renewals_total`: Total number of certificate renewals
- `nimble-opti-adapter_annotation_updates_duration_seconds`: Duration (in seconds) of annotation updates during each renewal
